Every few days, VOLUSPA collects data from 1.2 million Destiny players and takes note of who's got what.\n\nIt's been a hot topic as to whether it's accurate or useful and the truth is that all statistics are useless and dumb _unless_ you've included every single piece of data possible.\n\nThat said, it's a fair sample size and ever so slightly weighted towards more commited players (percentages may appear higher rather than lower due to the skill and attention of the users that are monitored).": "🌐",
