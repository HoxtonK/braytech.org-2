I'll do what I can to temper my language. It's actually very easy to abide by the following guidelines.\n\n- Don't be a wanker\n- Treat each other with respect\n- Don't use slurs (fag, faggot, gay, homo, are all hateful derogatory terms)\n- Next time you think to make a joke with your friends, consider first that it's only funny if **everyone** can be amused and feel comfortable\n- Everyone has a right to play Destiny in a safe environment\n\nYou may notice that these guidelines have little to do with being gay or otherwise and that isn't a coincidence. Be a nice Guardian to everyone. \n\n*If you disagree with any of these points, you can stop using Braytech immediately.*",
